# COVID-19-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this exploratory study, we scrutinize a database of over one million tweets collected from January to April 2021 to illustrate public attitudes towards vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Natural language processing, clustering and sentiment analysis techniques are employed to organize tweets relating to vaccination into high-level themes, then relaying narratives for each theme using automatic text summarization. 

In this study, such tweets are being extracted from Twitter using a Twitter API authentication token. The raw tweets are stored and processed using NLP. The processed data is then classified using a supervised KNN classification algorithm. The algorithm classifies the data into three classes, positive, negative, and neutral.
